## This Week in AI & Tech

> Google dropped Gemini 2.5 Ultra with state-of-the-art benchmarks, Meta continued its open-source blitz with a new Llama variant, and European companies scrambled to meet the first EU AI Act enforcement deadline. The theme this week: the gap between open and closed AI keeps narrowing.

## The Big Story

### Google Releases Gemini 2.5 Ultra

Google announced Gemini 2.5 Ultra, their most capable model to date. Key highlights include a 2 million token context window, native multimodal reasoning, and significant improvements in code generation benchmarks.

**Why it matters:** This puts direct competitive pressure on OpenAI and Anthropic. The 2M context window is particularly significant for enterprise document processing use cases.

**What comes next:** Expect rapid integration into Google Workspace and Cloud products over the coming weeks.

## Open Source & Tools

### Meta Open-Sources New Llama Architecture

Meta released a new Llama variant with mixture-of-experts architecture, achieving GPT-4 level performance at a fraction of the compute cost.

**Bottom Line:** Open-source models are now genuinely competitive with closed alternatives for most production use cases.

## Policy & Society

### EU AI Act Compliance Deadline Hits

February 2026 marks the first enforcement deadline for the EU AI Act. Companies deploying high-risk AI systems must now demonstrate compliance or face penalties up to 7% of global revenue.

**Bottom Line:** This is the beginning of real AI regulation with teeth. Companies operating in the EU need dedicated compliance infrastructure.

## Connecting the Dots

The convergence of more capable open models, increasing regulation, and fierce competition at the frontier suggests 2026 will be defined by **accessibility and accountability**. The technology is getting cheaper and more available, while the rules around its use are getting stricter and more concrete.
